# Hospital Management System (HMS)

## Problem Statement

Traditional paper-based hospital systems lead to inefficient record-keeping, difficulty in tracking patient history, and scheduling conflicts between doctors and patients. There is a need for a digital solution to streamline these operations.

## Scope

The HMS is a console-based application designed to digitize the fundamental operations of a hospital clinic. It focuses on patient registration, doctor management, and the coordination of appointments. The system ensures data persistence, allowing records to be saved and retrieved across sessions.

## Target Users

* Administrators: Can add doctors and view system logs.

* Receptionists: Register new patients and book appointments.

* Doctors: (Future scope) View their specific schedule.

## High-Level Features

* Patient Management: Register, update, and view patient details.

* Doctor Management: Maintain a directory of doctors and their specializations.

* Appointment Scheduling: Link patients to doctors with specific time slots.

* Data Persistence: Automatically save all data to local storage on exit.

* Error Handling: Robust validation for invalid IDs or scheduling conflicts.
